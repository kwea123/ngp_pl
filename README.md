add function of picture capture, and cliping space with Bbox

### Advertisement: Check out the latest integrated project [nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio)! There are a lot of recent improvements on nerf related methods, including instant-ngp!

<!-- ### Update 2022 July 29th: GUI prototype is available now (see following video)!

### Update 2022 July 24th: Training on custom data is possible now!

### Update 2022 July 14th: Multi-GPU training is available now! With multiple GPUs, now you can achieve high quality under a minute! -->

Instant-ngp (only NeRF) in pytorch+cuda trained with pytorch-lightning (**high quality with high speed**). This repo aims at providing a concise pytorch interface to facilitate future research, and am grateful if you can share it (and a citation is highly appreciated)!

*  [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp) another pytorch implementation that I highly referenced.

# :computer: Installation

This implementation has **strict** requirements due to dependencies on other libraries, if you encounter installation problem due to hardware/software mismatch, I'm afraid there is **no intention** to support different platforms (you are welcomed to contribute).

## Hardware

* OS: Ubuntu 20.04
* NVIDIA GPU with Compute Compatibility >= 75 and memory > 6GB (Tested with RTX 2080 Ti), CUDA 11.3 (might work with older version)
* 32GB RAM (in order to load full size images)

## Software

* Clone this repo by `git clone https://github.com/kwea123/ngp_pl`
* Python>=3.8 (installation via [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is recommended, use `conda create -n ngp_pl python=3.8` to create a conda environment and activate it by `conda activate ngp_pl`)
* Python libraries
    * Install pytorch by `pip install torch==1.11.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113`
    * Install `torch-scatter` following their [instruction](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter#installation)
    * Install `tinycudann` following their [instruction](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn#pytorch-extension) (pytorch extension)
    * Install `apex` following their [instruction](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex#linux)
    * Install core requirements by `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Cuda extension: Upgrade `pip` to >= 22.1 and run `pip install models/csrc/` (please run this each time you `pull` the code)

# :books: Supported Datasets

1.  NSVF data

Download preprocessed datasets (`Synthetic_NeRF`, `Synthetic_NSVF`, `BlendedMVS`, `TanksAndTemples`) from [NSVF](https://github.com/facebookresearch/NSVF#dataset). **Do not change the folder names** since there is some hard-coded fix in my dataloader.

2.  NeRF++ data

Download data from [here](https://github.com/Kai-46/nerfplusplus#data).

3.  Colmap data

For custom data, run `colmap` and get a folder `sparse/0` under which there are `cameras.bin`, `images.bin` and `points3D.bin`. The following data with colmap format are also supported:

  *  [nerf_llff_data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VnMcF1KJYxN9QId6TClMsZRahHNMW5g/view?usp=sharing) 
  *  [mipnerf360 data](http://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/refraw360/360_v2.zip)
  *  [HDR-NeRF data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OTDLLH8ydKX1DcaNpbQ46LlP0dKx6E-I). Additionally, download my colmap pose estimation from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXxgf_ZxNB4o67FVD_r0aBUIZVRgZYMX/view?usp=sharing) and extract to the same location.

4. RTMV data

Download data from [here](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mmeshry/projects/rtmv/). To convert the hdr images into ldr images for training, run `python misc/prepare_rtmv.py <path/to/RTMV>`, it will create `images/` folder under each scene folder, and will use these images to train (and test).

# :key: Training

Quickstart: `python train.py --root_dir <path/to/lego> --exp_name Lego`

It will train the Lego scene for 30k steps (each step with 8192 rays), and perform one testing at the end. The training process should finish within about 5 minutes (saving testing image is slow, add `--no_save_test` to disable). Testing PSNR will be shown at the end.

More options can be found in [opt.py](opt.py).

For other public dataset training, please refer to the scripts under `benchmarking`.

# :mag_right: Testing

Use `test.ipynb` to generate images. Lego pretrained model is available [here](https://github.com/kwea123/ngp_pl/releases/tag/v1.0)

GUI usage: run `python show_gui.py` followed by the **same** hyperparameters used in training (`dataset_name`, `root_dir`, etc) and **add the checkpoint path** with `--ckpt_path <path/to/.ckpt>`

# Comparison with torch-ngp and the paper

I compared the quality (average testing PSNR on `Synthetic-NeRF`) and the inference speed (on `Lego` scene) v.s. the concurrent work torch-ngp (default settings) and the paper, all trained for about 5 minutes:

| Method    | avg PSNR | FPS   | GPU     |
| :---:     | :---:    | :---: | :---:   |
| torch-ngp | 31.46    | 18.2  | 2080 Ti |
| mine      | 32.96    | 36.2  | 2080 Ti |
| instant-ngp paper | **33.18** | **60** | 3090 |

As for quality, mine is slightly better than torch-ngp, but the result might fluctuate across different runs.

As for speed, mine is faster than torch-ngp, but is still only half fast as instant-ngp. Speed is dependent on the scene (if most of the scene is empty, speed will be faster).
